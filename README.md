# supervised-machine-learning-challenge-
Module 19

This project utilizes machine learning modules such as LogisticRegression and Random ForestClassifer to classify and arrange data.

The project was to determine if loans were to be given or not, so the resources csv is a file filled with several thousand results of loans with many different variables
but all yielding a result of a given loan, or denied loan.

because this is a binary output, the LogisticRegression algorithm will be a great use to determine if it can find the variables to confidently predict if a loan will be given or not

This algorithm yields a accuracy rate of 99.3%!

The other algorithm (Random ForestClassifer) is a similar equation, however it is also capable of categorizing several different groups accuratley as well.

Yielding another very accurate rate of 99.1%
